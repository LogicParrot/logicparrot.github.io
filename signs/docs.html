<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>
This program analyzes specifically formatted ELAN output files. TODO explain more.
</p>

<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<ul>
<li>The program is case insensitive.</li>
<li>The program ignores spaces at the beginnings and ends of sentences. e.g. "hello " and "hello" are considered the same.</li>
<li>The program expects ELAN-style text file exports to be its input. See the sample input at the homepage.</li>
<li>The program was only tested with English (ASCII) characters, but it might work with others as well.</li>
<li>The program is generally verbose. It explains what is being done in each step and it
never discards data or skips errors without notifying the user.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tiers-timelines">Tiers and Timelines</h1>
<p>A tier is made up of two timelines. One of them is the movement timeline, and the other is the function timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>The movement timeline can be named anything, but shouldn't have the word "function".</li>
<li>The character "/" has a special meaning (split). See below.</li>
<li>The strings "decided -" or "decided-" are ignored and treated as nonexistent in both timeline names.</li>
<li>
	the function timeline should have the same name as its corresponding movement timeline,
	with "function{anything}" appended,where {anything} can be anything, including letters or words.
	<h2>Examples of correct pairs:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Head up, Head up function</li>
		<li>Head left/right, head left/right functions M</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Examples of imperfect pairs that will halt the program and print errors:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>head nod, head nods functions m</li>
		<li>head tilt left/right, head tilt functions m</li>
		<li>hn left/right, head nod function</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="movements">Movements</h1>
<p>Each tier has movements. A movement is made up of:
<ul>
	<li>movement text, begin time, and end time in the movement timeline</li>
	<li>function text, begin time, and end time in the function timeline</li>
</ul>
<p>Begin and end times MUST match perfectly in the two timelines.
Movements with missing text or misaligned times are discarded.</p>

<ul>
<li>If "movment text" or "function text" says "IGNORE" or "NF", the movement is ignored.</li>

<li>In "function text", the texts "{anything} x" and "{anything}" are considered identical.
   (the character "x" is used to signify strong movements, and the program doesn't care about those)</li>

<li>If "function text" is "{function1} + {function2}", the program assumes the given movement has two functions.
   This can also be done with 3 or more functions.</li>

<li>The "/" character works just like the "+" character. e.g. "{function1} / {function2}"
   *This remark is about function text, not to be confused with "/" in tier names (see below).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tier-split">Tier Splitting</h1>
<p>If a tier's movement timeline is named "{anything} {dir1}/{dir2}",
then the tier will be split into "{anything} {dir1}" and "{anything} {dir2}".
The movements are divided among the two new tiers based on each movement's "movement text",
The movement text MUST either be "{dir1}" or "{dir2}", otherwise the movement is discarded.</p>

<h1 id="alignments">Alignments</h1>
<ul>
<li>Two movements are considered "aligned" when either of them's time period is covered 80% by the other's.</li>
<li>An "alignment group" is a collection of aligned movements involving 2 or more specific tiers. Any two movements
within an alignment group are "aligned".</li>
<li>A "rank" of an alignment group is the number of involved tiers in that group.</li>
</ul>
